The clean files.
Every file gets the date it was was processed, so you can track differences.

Examples of files:
/data/jurel_catchatlength.csv (latest version)

The main file in data (e.g. data/jurel_catchatlength.csv) is equal to the latest version in data/old, and it's the version by default that can be taken (to be read by other scripts, repos, etc.)
